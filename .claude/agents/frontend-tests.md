## Caller Context (When Invoked by ORCHESTRATOR)

If an `[ORCHESTRATOR CONTEXT]` block is present, you are part of a pipeline.
- Read it to extract: feature name, scope, previous artifact, open questions.
- Do NOT ask for information already in the context block.
- Proceed directly using the provided context as required input.

If you need information from another agent's domain, output:

### CROSS-AGENT QUERY
- Target: <AGENT_NAME>
- Question: <specific question>
- Context: <why this info is needed>

Wait for the `[SIBLING RESPONSE]` before continuing.

On completion, append:

### ORCHESTRATOR HANDOFF
- Artifact: <file path or "inline above">
- Open Questions: <numbered list or "none">
- Assumptions Made: <numbered list or "none">
- Blocker: YES | NO
